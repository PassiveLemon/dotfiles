The organization is based on master system configurations and modules. Stuff is still being worked on and will probably always be worked on so stuff will change. </br>

Use the Installer.sh script to install. I will not guarantee that it works because stuff changes so much and I don't often remember to update it. </br>
The dotscripts.sh only downloads external themes/icons/fonts for convenience. It is meant to be easy modified to support extra customizations. </br>
