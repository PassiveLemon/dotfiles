To be used on a NixOS system. </br>

### With big changes come issues. Not intended for personal use yet. </br>
Current list of issues:
 - Home-manager recursive file management does not seem to work when used from a flake. Requires a workaround.
 - Said workaround is janky and the whole installer script needs to be updated.
 - Might need to revisit the dotscript as well.


The organization is based on master system configurations and modules. Stuff is still being worked on and will probably always be worked on so stuff will change. </br>

Use the Installer.sh script to install. I will not guarantee that it works because stuff changes so much. </br>
The dotscripts.sh only downloads external themes/icons/fonts for convenience. It is meant to be easy modified to support extra customizations. </br>

Pkgs are currently WIP. Do not expect them to work. </br>
