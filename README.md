These are my dotfiles for my NixOS system. This is configuration for the stuff I use on a daily basis, so things will ALWAYS be changing. This is for my own organization and preservation so I will NOT guarantee compatibility on other systems. </br>

## Overview </br>
- NixOS system flake with Home-Manager.
- Extensible modules for NixOS and Home-Manager.
- AwesomeWM configuration:
  - Bar + systray under NixOS icon
  - Lockscreen + PAM authentication (Supports fprintd)
  - Media player, powermenu, resource monitor
  - Wacky little crosshairs for games
  - Playerctl and system resource signals
- Tym terminal with Hilbish as the terminal shell.
- Custom color theme for Discord, VSCode, and Obsidian. (GTK WIP)
- Volantes Cursors
- Papirus Icons
- Common configuration for a variety of programs.
