These are my dotfiles for my NixOS system. I like using Lua so a lot of the configurations in here are Lua. This is for my own organization and preservation so I will not guarantee compatability on other systems. Stuff changes a lot. </br>
## Features </br>
* NixOS system flake with Home-Manager. Based around a single user for each host.
* Extensible modules. System customization, Spicetify, picom, etc.
* AwesomeWM configuration with a couple extra UI elements: Music player, powermenu, resource monitor.
* Tym terminal with Hilbish as the terminal shell. Bash is the default user shell and Dash is the system shell.
* Lite XL as the primary editor with plugins and VSCodium for other needs.
* Rofi theme to match the Awesome theme.
* Discord theme with BetterDiscord CSS.
* Htop, Neofetch.
* System theme to match the Matcha Dark Aliz GTK theme.
* Volantes Cursors
* Papirus Icons
* You must put your own wallpaper at `~/.wallpaper-image`. Do not include an extension.

## Install </br>
Use the Installer.sh script in other. I will not guarantee that it works because stuff changes so much and I don't often remember to update it. </br>
